# int-code-example
A small provision to allow attendees to write opennlp code

The idea behind this is to present this small project to people attending an interview. 
It is not a test, but a "how do you work". The objective isn't to present a problem and watch them solve it per se, 
more how they approach a fairly open ended task; one of "can you use opennlp to find entities in a piece of text?".
We assume zero knowledge of opennlp, but the pom includes the dependencies, and the models are already downloaded too.
They can use Google to find out what Opennlp is, how to write a very simple bit of code to deal with some text.

That's about it... there's no right or wrong answer, there's no expectation ... just how they go about approaching it :)
